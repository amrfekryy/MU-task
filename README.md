#### Ideas to improve project
- I was planning to implement a feature that allows to switch application direction between `ltr (left to right)` and `rtl (right to left)` when switching between English and Arabic languages respectively. This would improve the display of the Arabic version drastically. But it needs more time to be implemented since a lot of component details need to be taken into consideration.
