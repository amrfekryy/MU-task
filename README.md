#### Run Project
- clone / install project
- cd into project directory
- `npm install` then `npm start`

#### Notes
- In `src/redux/` you can find an advanced implementation of a Redux store with some advanced tools used to dynamically generate reducers, actions, and dispatchers.
- In `src/styles/_contols.scss` you can find controls for applicaion styling

#### Ideas to improve project
- I was planning to implement a feature that allows to switch application direction between `ltr (left to right)` and `rtl (right to left)` when switching between English and Arabic languages respectively. This would improve the display of the Arabic version drastically. But it needs more time to be implemented since a lot of component details need to be taken into consideration.
